# Smart-Home project
SmartBuilding is a next generation platform for managing IoT enhanced smart building. 
The platform serves as the controller and integration hub for modules, devices, controllers and sensors that will enable efficient and comfortable operation of the building.

# Description
The central hub is a server application that serves mainly as a host for software
agents representing the devices. It will provide an efficient mechanism to receive
events from sensors and dispatch these events to relevant controllers.
- Provide a detailed level design.
- Provide an implementation using C++ for a POSIX compliant system.
- Provide Multi-threading optimization solutions.
